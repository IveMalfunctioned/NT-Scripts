# NT-Scripts
A collection of scripts I've created or edited to de-crapify Windows.

This is a collection of scripts I've created or edited to de-crapify Windows, specifically Windows 10 but it'll probably work with little compatibility issues for Windows 7 and newer.

Decrapify: A script I edited that fixes Microsoft's BS that they put in Windows, such as tracking & telemetry, bloatware, various settings, and other little tweaks here and there.

Changes: Added functionality to uninstall Edge Chromium & Cortana, disable Windows Defender, set network type to private, disable first sign-in animation, show seconds on clock, and fixed an issue where running the script would break Windows search (ctfmon).
Make sure you customize this script before running it! Never blindly run a script you download off of the internet.

Autofirewall: A script I made to automatically add a list of exe files or all exe files in a list of directories recursively to the firewall in order to deny them internet for better privacy.

Restore corrupted system files: A simple automated script I made to run dism restorehealth and sfc scannow back to back.
