# NT-Scripts
A collection of scripts I've created or edited to de-crapify Windows.

This is a collection of scripts I've created or edited to de-crapify Windows, specifically Windows 10 but it'll probably work with little compatibility issues for Windows 7 and newer.

Decrapify: Fixes Microsoft's BS that they put in Windows, such as tracking & telemetry, bloatware, various settings, and other little tweaks here and there.
Autofirewall: A script to automatically add a list of exe files or all exe files in a list of directories recursively to the firewall in order to deny them internet for better privacy.
Restore corrupted system files: A simple automated script to run dism restorehealth and sfc scannow back to back.
